All explanation is achieved by metaphor. X is Y, where Y is something that the person receiving the explanation already knows and thus can translate understanding from Y to X; or Y is a composite concept formed by uniting and qualifying more narrowly defined and (hopefully) common concepts with which people receiving the explanation might be expected to know.

Taking notes (writing) supports a zen approach to cognition. Every idea is transitory, writing down allows for organizing and retrieving them. Don't try to hold ideas in your head. Develop the skill of thinking, not storing ideas.

How to think of complexity? How to quantify it? It takes a lot of work. Literaly, that is a good way to quantify complexity. The work required grows and that growth is the point. Increasing complexity, or performing a lot of work, are similar from the point of view of administration. Why are big engineering projects often over budget and late? Reasons range from politics and economics to psychological. But a physical description of the nature: a large work load imposes power requirements. The energy flows through systems and materials are limited, and the growth in flow (cf Smil) needs to be accounted for in the design of the systems involved in that work.
